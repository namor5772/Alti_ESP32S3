This is a repository for my digital altimeter based on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. It uses an I2C interfaced pressure/temperature sensor board based on the MS5637 chip and an 84x48 SPI interfaced lcd screen based on the PCD8544 chip. The electronics is housed in the enclosure used by an old analog skydiving altimeter.
